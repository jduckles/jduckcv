### Overview

I am a researcher, entreprenuer and tinkerer who enjoys leading and
working with cross-disciplinary teams to apply appropriate technology, toward
challenging research, business and technical problems.  Specific domains of
experience and interest are: the study of global ecological and environmental
change; agricultural production; land-use land-cover change; applied remote
sensing; geospatial analysis; long-term technology planning and open source tools for data processing and
management.  

I work at [The University of
Oklahoma](http://ou.edu) and coordiante the activities of Research Informatics
team, a part of the broader [OUIT](http://it.ou.edu) organization.  Recently I
have become a [Software-Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org) instructor
and enjoy traveling the country teaching groups of scientists about programming
in [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) & [Python](https://www.python.org/), using
the [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell to automate tasks and infecting them with a
passion for the collaborative potential of version control using
[git](http://git-scm.com/) and [github](http://github.com).

### Personal
My wife is Antonina and I have two boys age 7 and 5.  I practice tha martial art
of [Judo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo) and hold a nidan (second black
belt) and actively participate in coaching/teaching at USA Stars Foundation
under sensei Patrick Burris.  I enjoy cooking, gardening,
camping/hiking and international travel.  Recently I've been having fun tinkering a bit
more with embeded microcontroller development environments like
[Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) and [Energia](www.energia.nu) when I can find
the time.
